# wavGUI
This is a simple Python GUI to read and view wav files. It also calculates an FFT and A-weighted FFT of the sound.

To execute you can either install python (version 3.8.2) and all needed packages with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then execute the code with:
```
python main.py
```

The second option (on a Windows machine) is to execute the main.exe file in the dist/main folder. This does not require any installments of python or any packages.
