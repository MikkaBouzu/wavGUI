# wavGUI
This is a simple Python GUI to read and view wav files. It also calculates an FFT and A-weighted FFT of the sound.

To execute you can either install python (version 3.8.2) and all needed packages with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or execute the main.exe file in the dist/main folder.
